# Energy Management Scale Analysis using SPSS

## Overview

This repository documents the analysis of survey data collected from post-secondary students to assess their energy management strategies. Using IBM SPSS Statistics, this project focuses on cleaning the data, constructing scales based on the framework developed by Zhang et al. (2018), evaluating the reliability (internal consistency) of these scales within the student sample, and comparing the findings against the original published research.

## Objectives

1.  Clean, merge, and prepare raw survey data for analysis in SPSS.
2.  Construct composite scales (Physical, Emotional, Spiritual, Mental Energy Management) based on established literature.
3.  Evaluate the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) of the constructed scales.
4.  Assess the normality of the scale distributions.
5.  Compare the reliability results from the student sample with the benchmark results from Zhang et al. (2018).
